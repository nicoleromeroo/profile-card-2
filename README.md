# Profile Card â€“ HTML & CSS Practice Project

This project is part of my personal journey into frontend development. It marks one of my very first attempts at building something using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal was to understand and apply core concepts such as:

- Structuring content with HTML
- Styling with CSS (colors, typography, layout)
- Working with Flexbox for layout alignment
- Creating responsive, visually clean UI components

While this project is simple, it helped me develop a foundational understanding of how websites are built from scratch. Over time, I plan to revisit and improve this card as my skills progress.

Reflections
Starting this project was a great way to get hands-on with web development. I faced challenges with layout and spacing, but gradually understood how Flexbox works. I'm looking forward to building more components and eventually learning JavaScript.
